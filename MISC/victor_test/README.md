#  Victor Test Version 1.0

   Matt Bull - Victor Test Version 1.0
   
This program is designed to run the victors across their full output range in order to verify their functionality.
Alternatively, it can also be used to run a single motor for a specified period of time at a chosen speed.

 Setup:
   1. Wire the motor and 12V battery to the victor. DO THIS BEFORE CONNECTING A PWM CABLE TO THE VICTOR!
    Proper wiring between the arduino and the victor to be tested:
   2. Connect the black wire from the PWM cable to one of the GND pins on the arduino.
   3. Connect the white wire from the PWM cable to PIN 9 on the arduino.
   4. Upload this program to the arduino and remove power from the arduino.
   5. Wire motor to victor.
   6. Connect a PWM cable to the victor, with the white wire facing outwards.
