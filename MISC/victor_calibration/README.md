#  Victor Calibration V1

Matt Bull - Victor Calibration V1
  
  This program is designed to calibrate victors.
   Alternatively, it can also be used to run a single motor for a specified period of time at a chosen speed.

   Setup:
   1. Wire the motor and 12V battery to the victor. DO THIS BEFORE CONNECTING A PWM CABLE TO THE VICTOR!

    Proper wiring between the arduino and the victor to be tested:
    2. Connect the black wire from the PWM cable to one of the GND pins on the arduino.
    3. Connect the white wire from the PWM cable to PIN 9 on the arduino.

   4. Upload this program to the arduino and remove power from the arduino.
   5. Wire motor to victor.
   6. Connect a PWM cable to the victor, with the white wire facing outwards.
